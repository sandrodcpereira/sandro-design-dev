			<h2>Hi! My name is Sandro, and I'm a Portuguese designer based in London.</h2>

			<p>I knew I wanted to draw for a living from very early on — paper and pencils were all the toys I needed to keep me entertained for hours. Other than LEGO, I mean.</p>

			<p>A few years later, in the late nineties, I fell in love with <a href="https://twitter.com/ianTDR" target="_blank">Ian Anderson</a>'s and The Designer Republic's incredibly sleek and futuristic work in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipeout_(video_game)" target="_blank">Wipeout</a> videogame franchise and realised that design was what I wanted to do for a living.</p>

			<p>The final piece of the puzzle was using a touchscreen for the first time: interacting directly with software opened the door to computer tools that could provide interesting and fun experiences. I instantly knew that's what I wanted to do for a living.</p>

			<p>Being mostly self-taught, I absolutely love experimenting with different styles and learning how to use new tools and techniques — is there anything more exciting than mastering something new and imagining all the cool things you can do with it?</p>
