				<h2>Context</h2>

				<p>In early 2017, Akkroo had found its niche in the <abbr title="Business to Business">B2B</abbr> market and was maturing as a product.</p>

				<p>With the company focusing on building processes and providing a great customer experience, the onboarding for new customers was overwhelmingly positive, but most of the work was very manual and required the <abbr title="Customer Success">CS</abbr> team to guide users through learning tasks and provide useful assets like guides and helpers via email.</p>

				<p>With the aim to help automate this process in a scalable way, we decided to offload some of these responsibilities onto the product.</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				
				<h2>Problem</h2>

				<p>We framed this project around the user persona of the Marketing Manager, who is the typical user of the Akkroo dashboard.</p> 

				<p>Using the <a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank">Jobs to Be Done</a> framework, we arrived at the following goal:</p>

				<blockquote class="jtbd">As <u>Megan Marketing</u>, I want to be able to <u>find any resource I need</u> in order to <u>use Akkroo successfully</u>.</blockquote>

			</section>

				<h2>Discovery and ideation</h2>

				<p>To begin addressing this problem, we first worked very closely with the <abbr title="Customer Success">CS</abbr> team in order to understand what the onboarding process usually entailed. With this exercise, we got to understand which resources were available, which ones customers found most useful, what training tasks they were asked to perform, and so on.</p>

				<p>Having learnt that, we started laying out the elements in the page, paying close attention to the prioritisation of the information.</p>

				<p>For new customers, we designed a system of helpful steps and tips — starring Akkroo’s mascot, Kangakkroo — in order to help guide them though the platform while performing various tasks.</p>

				<p>Other gamification aspects — like achievement badges — were discussed and considered in order to incentivise the completion of all the onboarding tasks, but were eventually dropped due to the limited resources and deadline commitments.</p>

				<p>As my first big project with the Akkroo Dashboard, I was keen to spend some time making sure we provided a delightful experience through the use of fun microinteractions. These were implemented by me using a combination of animations designed using After Effects and Lottie.</p>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>

				<p>The Success Hub proved successful (no pun intended) by offloading some of the very manual tasks from our <abbr title="Customer Success">CS</abbr> team, freeing them to spend more time providing a great experience to our customers.</p>

				<p><b>Value added:</b></p>

				<ul class="value">
					<li>Dashboard users became less dependent on the <abbr title="Customer Success">CS</abbr> team to access content and receive training.</li>
					<li>Successful proof of concept for using Lottie for more intricate interactions.</li>

				</ul>

				<p><b>Room for improvement:</b></p>

				<ul class="improvements">
					<li>Most gamification elements were not implemented, despite us having some really interesting ideas that would have certainly delighted customers and driven up the engagement.</li>
				</ul>
