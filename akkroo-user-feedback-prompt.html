				<h2>Context</h2>

				<p>One of the main goals of the Akkroo product is to replace traditional lead capture methods (think paper forms and badge scanners) used by sales representatives at trade shows. Despite this, Akkroo is typically sold to marketing departments for its powerful integration and monitoring capabilities — not sales teams, the ones attending the trade shows.</p>

				<p>Because of this, direct contact with sales teams — the people using our app — has historically been very limited, which meant that we knew very little about the context in which the app was being used and any problems associated with it.</p>

				<h2>Problem</h2>

				<p>We framed this project around the user persona of the Sales Representative, who is the typical user of the Akkroo dashboard.</p> 

				<p>Using the <a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank">Jobs to Be Done</a> framework, we arrived at the following goal:</p>

				<blockquote class="jtbd">As <u>Serena Sales</u>, I want to be able to <u>easily report bugs and give feedback after each event</u> in order to <u>improve lead capture process using the app</u>.</blockquote>

				<h2>Discovery and ideation</h2>

				<p>Knowing what we wanted to empower our users to do, we decided to build a way for app users to give us feedback about their experience with our product.</p>

				<p>In a joint effort with our <abbr title="Customer Success">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Customer Experience">CX</abbr> teams, we put a lot of thought into deciding who would receive these prompts and when. Spamming users would lead to frustration, asking them during a show would be distracting, prompting them too long after the event could mean they might forget some important points.</p>

						<p>In addition to all the thought put into who is prompted to give feedback, we also made sure giving this feedback was as easy and seamless as possible.</p>

						<p>After experimenting with a few ideas, we ended up with a very easy flow that allows for a very quick positive or negative response, plus an optional text input for any additional comments.</p>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>

				<p>This project turned out to be one of the most significant of my career because of its impact and simplicity.</p>

				<p>The final solution was incredibly straightforward in design but the feedback collected through it is something that is still today providing an incredible volume of important data that has informed product decisions ever since it was introduced — almost two years ago as of this writing.</p>

				<p><b>Value added:</b></p>

				<ul class="value">
					<li>App users are finally given a voice!</li>
					<li>Great volume of constant feedback that is used to inform product decisions.</li>
